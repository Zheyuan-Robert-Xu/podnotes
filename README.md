## App Startup

On starting up the app you will see the login screen where a user's
WebID is to be entered. It will be remembered for future app
activity. To obtain a WebID for yourself, visit
https://solidcommunity.net/register. On clicking the Login button your
browser will popup to authenticate you on the Solid server, not on the
device. The device does not get to know your login details.
