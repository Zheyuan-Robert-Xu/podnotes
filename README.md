## App Startup

On starting up the app you will see the login screen where a user's
WebID is to be entered. It will be remembered for future app
activity. To obtain a WebID for yourself, visit our experimental
[Australian Solid Community Pod
Server](https://pods.solidcommunity.au/.account/login/password/register/)
or any one of the available [Pod
Providers](https://solidproject.org/users/get-a-pod) world wide. On
clicking the Login button your browser will popup to authenticate you
on the Solid server of choice, not on the device. The device does not
get to know your login details.
